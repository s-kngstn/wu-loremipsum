Weird behaviors - Text input value types
- If I type "1.2" into the text input it will return 3 requested values. Same as if I type
  "2.5" it returns 7.
- If I change the type of text input from string to Number. It changes it to number but doesnt pick
  up or recognize the change in a conditional statement.
